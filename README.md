# What is Stattracker?
<!-- Thu, Jul 24, 2025 10:21 -->

Stattracker is a simple TUI tool to motivate you when it comes to
tasks you have to repeat. You create and name a new task which will
be displayed on the dashboard. Each stat can rank up and with a new
rank, you get a fancy animation and a new title. You do this by
contributing or by essentially checking off the specific stat on your
dashboard.

The amount of contributions you need to rank up, how many ranks there
are, which title is given after each rank, can all be configured when
making a new stat.

Do you know the Persona games? I loved them and played most of them
while growing up. From Persona 3 onwards, you had social links and
stats. Essentially, when you repeatedly spent time doing a certain
activity like studying, working at a restaurant or chatting with a
friend, you would get points. Accumulate enough points and your link
would be upgraded. You would get a fancy animation and a new name.

Example: you would spend time working part time at a club. This would
increase your charm. After several times, your charm turns from
"head turning" to "suave".

During highschool, I was a model student. However, after graduation, I
realized that I was caught up in procastination. In order to remedy
that, I decided to make a simple TUI app to keep track of my own stats
and social links to motivate myself.
